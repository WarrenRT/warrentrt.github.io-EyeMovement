Eye Movement

When a user moves their curser, the eyes follow the curser. Eyes are positioned with div layers and move with Javascript functions.

<H1>How to Run:</H1>
Dowload all three files and save them in the same folder. Open the HTML file to view as a webpage.

<H1>Roadmap of future improvements:</H1>
In the future, I'd like to add a different background and possibly add other features to make the eyes look more realistic.
